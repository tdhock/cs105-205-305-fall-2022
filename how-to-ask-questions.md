# How to web search then ask questions

Students, please follow this guide in order to quickly and effectively
get your question answered on slack.
I know this seems like a lot work, but there are 200+ of you
and lots of questions to answer. This will hopefully get you answers
faster and save us all some frustration!

## Are you in the right directory?

By far the most frequent issue is a message such as "no such file or directory" or "file not found."
Often the problem is that you are not in the right working directory.
Fix by changing working directory (cd command).

## Before asking a question: do a web search

Learning to solve your own problems as they come up is a very
important skill to learn.  Also, we cannot provide documentation for
every single error every student might have.  Therefore, before asking
a question, you should try to find the answer yourself by performing a
web search.

* For all of your assignments (in this class as well as in your other
  classes), please remember web search (Google) is your friend! If you
  are encountering a particular computer problem, it is likely that
  someone else has in the past as well, and has already posted a
  solution to that problem online somewhere.
* The first web search you should try: use the name of the program you
  are running, and the exact wording of the error/message that you see
  from that program, for example the first web page for the search
  "scp permission denied" explains the usage of the scp command, and
  probably is sufficient for understanding how to get scp working.
* If that first web search does not help, you should try a more
  specific web search that includes the hardware/OS you are using, and
  perhaps the keywords "work-around" or "alternative." For example
  searching for "m1 mac virtualbox unsupported hardware architecture
  detected alternative" yields a forum web page which suggests UTM as
  an alternative to virtualbox.
* Academic integrity: it is OK to read the documentation about how to
  use the computer, even from a web search. It is not OK to take code
  from the web and claim it as your own.

## Please follow the formatting rules for submitting your question

If you do not, our first response back to you may be asking for more
information.

### What not to do

In general, try not to ask questions like "Is this correct?" or "What
is the right answer?" We try not to provide the exact solutions to the
homeworks on Slack as the goal of the homework is for you to learn a
useful skill.

### Platform Info

Please write what program, operating system, computer, and
processor/CPU you are using (along with the version of each). For
example,

* I am using WSL2 build 21364 on Windows 10 build 19044.2006 on a
  Surface Pro X tablet with ARM processor/CPU.
* I am using UTM v4.0.4 on macOS Monterey 12.4 on an Macbook Air
  laptop with an M1 processor/CPU.

### Context

Explain the conditions that lead to your question. For example

* I am working on the Module 3 homework assignment, question Q03, and
  I am trying to compute the counts of secondary types of all
  Pokemon. I tried using the command "cat pokemon.csv | uniq -c" and I
  expected to see different numbers of counts, but I
  observed that all the counts are equal to 1.

### What web searches you have tried so far

Please list the web searches you have tried to solve your
issue/problem, for example:

* I'm trying to install an Ubuntu VM in Virtualbox on my M1 Mac
  laptop, and I keep getting an error message that says "unsupported
  hardware architecture detected." So I tried the web search
  "virtualbox unsupported hardware" and also the more specific query
  "m1 mac virtualbox unsupported hardware architecture detected." Both
  web searches yielded web pages that describe the same problem I am
  having, but none of the web pages provided a way to actually install
  virtualbox on my mac.

### Provide a screenshots when appropriate.

The old saying "a picture's worth 1000 words" rings true in this case.

# How to submit homeworks

When you submit homework, you are reponsible for making sure the document is a PDF file, and that you can open and read it in a PDF reader.
After previewing it in a PDF reader, then you should submit/upload to bblearn.
