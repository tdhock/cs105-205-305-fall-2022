The goal of Part I is to make sure you have paid close attention to the reading and videos as well as to the guided activities associated with the module. 

Part I of the Final Exam is timed with a limit of 10 minutes before attempts are auto-submitted on your behalf. 
	
You will have 2 attempts at Part I of the Final Exam and you will be graded based on your last attempt. 
	
You must submit your final attempt before the deadline, or you will receive a 0 on the quiz.
	
Quiz questions are pulled from a bank of questions, so if you take the quiz again, you may not necessarily see the same questions.

Part II of the exam will focus on assessing your ability to apply your
knowledge to a series of tasks. It will involve reading text files on
a remote server, linux.ac.nau.edu, and running some commands on that
server to analyze those text files, so please review the relevant
course material.

Inability to SSH into the server is not a valid reason for not
completing Part II of the Final Exam.

If you run into technical issues while attempting the exam, you need
to work them out yourself (please do not post questions in slack),
since this is an exam.

This is a timed, open-ended test with a single attempt. You will have
one attempt at the test and you will be given 90 minutes (ample time
given the assignment).

This is an open book portion of the exam, but you are expected to
adhere to the NAU Academic Integrity Policy. You may use the texts,
course content, and your notes to help you, but this is meant to be a
reflection of your own work and understanding of the
material. Violations will result in a zero grade on the exam and
likely (given the weighting system) a failed grade in the class.
